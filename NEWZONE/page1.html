                <p>The Rainy Green Man Zone will be revamped to be more organized and a diary for the key- passwords will be added, along with new animation gimmicks in the comic. A biography zone will be added to the main page after the new year. An error may have occurred on the website.</p>

                <p>The CRAZY CITY website is now accessible for free (although some features may be restricted to members only). It includes my Buy Me a Coffee promotion page, an update section to check what's new, and a page to read the comic 'The Rainy Green Man.' There are many more sections I want to create, but they’re still in progress. Future sections will include: a store, videos, artwork, short comics, and character profiles. Special member-exclusive sections will feature: the NSFL zone, The Lélisin'onne Family Cult Club, and Date with characters.</p>
